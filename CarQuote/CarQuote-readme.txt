Our project used web pages that are on the INSTTECH server under _445team6/public_html. I have included all of the files on there as well as the files that are used for the database. There is a file called master script file that is what we used to create the database. All of the files are included in separate folders based on what they were used for (Database and Website). I also included the video file, or you can find the video at the following URL:
